    "Given a paragraph and a list of banned words, return the most frequent word that is not in the list of banned words.  It is guaranteed there is at least one word that isn't banned, and that the answer is unique.\n",

    "Explanation: \n",
    "\"hit\" occurs 3 times, but it is a banned word.\n",
    "\"ball\" occurs twice (and no other word does), so it is the most frequent non-banned word in the paragraph. \n",
    "Note that words in the paragraph are not case sensitive,\n",

    "and that \"hit\" isn't the answer even though it occurs more because it is banned. \n",

    "    There are no hyphens or hyphenated words.\n",
    "    Words only consist of letters, never apostrophes or other punctuation symbols."
